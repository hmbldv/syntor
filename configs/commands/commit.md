Analyze the staged git changes and create a conventional commit message.

Review the following:
1. What files were changed
2. What type of change this is (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
3. The scope of the change if applicable

Then generate a commit message following the conventional commits format:
type(scope): description

Include a brief body if the changes are complex.
